Hello, let me introduce myself, I am Altaf, here I want to try to become a validator,
although I am still new and do not have much experience to become a validator, at least I have been a validator in several testnets such as:

-quicksilver
-stride
-squid network
-nubit
-celestia
and several other projects.

I would certainly be very happy and very grateful if I were accepted as a participant in this validator race, 
because this will increase my experience and knowledge about validators.
